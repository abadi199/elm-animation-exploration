# Elm Animation Exploration

Slide: https://elm-animation-exploration.netlify.com


This project is for exploring the idea of doing highly performant animation in Elm with a nice API.

It's presented at [Elm-Conf 2019](https://2019.elm-conf.com/speakers/abadi-kurniawan) with the title: **Building Highly Performant Animations in Elm**

## Contribution
This is an experimental project, and doesn't support all types of animation yet. I'm interested to build and publish a more complete package, but I have a limited free time.

If you think this is a good idea and you're interested in collaborating to make this library a published Elm package, reach out to me at:
